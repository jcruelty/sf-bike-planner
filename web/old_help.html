<dt><b>1. How did you make this?</b>
<dd>My notes are publicly accessible <a href="http://google.com/notebook/public/03943918533095911422/BDQ-aSwoQqduj3qwi">here</a>.  If you find them useful, please credit me & link back to <a href="http://amarpai.com/bikemap/bikemap.html">http://amarpai.com/bikemap</a>.
<p><dt><b>2. What does bike-friendly mean?</b>
<dd>There are several categories of road in San Francisco.  From a bicyclist's point of view, here they are from least friendly to most friendly:<br>
<table border=1>
<tr>
<td>
road
<td>
an ordinary street - no special allowances for bikes-- may have high traffic
<tr>
<td>
bike route     
<td>
an unstriped, signed roadway shared by bicycles and motorized vehicles. (e.g. any street that has that bike thingy painted on it, like you see along the wiggle)
<tr>
<td>
wide curb lane
<td>a bike route's right-hand traffic lane that is wide enough to accommodate bicycles and motorized
vehicles side by side in the same lane. (e.g. 17th st from mission to noe)
<tr>
<td>
bike lane
<td>a part of the roadway which is striped and signed for bicycles only (e.g. valencia)
<tr>
<td>
bike path
<td>an off-road paved trail for bicycles.
</table>
<br>A bike friendly route is one which maximizes time spent on the better categories of road, e.g. bike lanes are preferred to wide curb lanes and wide curb lanes are preferred to plain roads.  Note that staying on just bike-friendly roads means you can't always go the most direct way to your destination; hence bike friendly routes tend to be longer than the shortest path route.

<dt><b>3. What is "steepest climb" ? What units are hills measured in?</b>
<dd>
This parameter is the maximum <a href="http://www.roberts-1.com/bikehudson/r/m/hilliness/index.htm#grade">grade</a> (rise / run, in feet) that you're willing to tolerate.
.25 is really steep, .15 is pretty steep, .05 is slight incline, 0 is flat.
